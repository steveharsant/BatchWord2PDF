# BatchWord2PDF

Convert a folder of Word documents to PDF files in 2 clicks

## Requirements

Unfortunately, Microsoft Word is required to be installed, so LibreOffice or other alternatives will not work (for now). This also means it only works on Windows.

## Installation

1. Visit [the releases page](https://github.com/steveharsant/BatchWord2PDF/releases).
2. Pick the version you want (latest is usually best)
3. Download either the ***BatchWord2PDF-Installer.exe*** or ***BatchWord2PDF-Portable.zip***. The installer version does not require admin rights and is recommended if you are not sure.
4. * For the installer version: run the downloaded file to install. ***BatchWord2PDF*** will now be found in your start menu.
   * For the portable version: unzip all files to a folder of your choice and run the ***BatchWord2PDF.exe*** binary.

## Usage

1. Run the app
2. Click on the folder icon, and select your folder of Word documents
3. Click Convert
4. There is no step 4

## Why Another Conversion Tool?

In the wild there seems to only be 4 options each with their own problems:

* Paid for closed-source software
* Online conversion tools
* Super dodgy closed-sourced free software/possible malware
* Powershell scripts

I wanted a free, open source, end user-friendly, and safe tool to convert multiple PDF's with as little effort as possible, so I created this.
