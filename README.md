# BatchWord2PDF

Convert a folder of Word documents to PDF files in 2 clicks

## Requirements

Unfortunately, Microsoft Word is required to be installed, so LibreOffice or other alternatives will not work (for now). This also means it only works on Windows.

## Usage

1. Run the app
2. Click on the folder icon, and select your folder of Word documents
3. Click Convert
4. There is no step 4

## Why Another Conversion Tool?

In the wild there seems to only be 4 options each with their own problems:

* Paid for closed-source software
* Online conversion tools
* Super dodgy closed-sourced free software/possible malware
* Powershell scripts

I wanted a free, open source, end user-friendly, and safe tool to convert multiple PDF's with as little effort as possible, so I created this.
